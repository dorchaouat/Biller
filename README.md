# Biller
Web app designed with HTML / CSS and JavaScript (Vanilla + Node.JS) used to manage bills and payments between roommates where they share the same UI (showing the household's payments for the current month) by assigning their profile to the same household located on a firebase server. Each user can add a payment they paid for and should be reimbursed by the other roommates, with each payment holding information.

Biller is an individual project created from scratch only by the two of us. We are both second year software development students who decide to expand out programming skills beyond the university's curriculum and create a self taught HTML, CSS, JavaScript project.
